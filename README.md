# Calculator - JavaScript Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Project
This is a simple calculator project built with JavaScript, utilizing the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The main objective of this mini project is to provide a practical exercise to practice and enhance JavaScript skills.

## Features
Basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Clear functionality to reset the calculator.
## Technologies Used
JavaScript: The project is implemented entirely using JavaScript, taking advantage of the object-oriented paradigm to organize and structure the code effectively.
## How to Use
Follow the link below to access the calculator: https://fedemoretto11.github.io/Calculadora/
## Project Structure
- index.html: The main HTML file that displays the calculator interface.  
- styles.css: The CSS file that contains the styles for the calculator's appearance.  
- script.js: The JavaScript file that contains the calculator's functionality, implemented using OOP principles.  
## Purpose
This project serves as a valuable exercise to practice JavaScript and improve programming skills, specifically focusing on the implementation of object-oriented programming concepts. By building a calculator using OOP, developers can gain a deeper understanding of how to organize code, manage state, and encapsulate functionality.

Feel free to explore, modify, and expand upon this project to further enhance your JavaScript capabilities.
